                <p class="lead">My name is Naeem Shafi. I have completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Pakistan. I am a professional IT engineer. I have IT Support experience from Pakistan and UAE. My hobbies include reading books, learning new skills and helping people. 
My future goal is to become a Web Developer. I was introduced to this field in one of my previous jobs and there I realized how interesting and amazing this field is, everything you write comes to life and you can actually see the results of your development in a live environment. I want to use my passion for development to improve my community and people. 
                     <br> I want to join TKH bootcamp to be able to learn faster. To be taught by professionals who actually knows what skills and abilities are required in real job. 
                     <br> 
                     I have come accross thousands of resources online and they have been helpful but at the end of the day I find myself with so many resources that it gets difficult to figure out which one to actually choose thats where I think that a bootcamp will help me fullfill my dream of becoming a developer faster and become more professional.
                     <br>
                     I want to have friends and colleagues with same mindset and profession so I can discuss and talk to them about programming.
                     <br> 
                     I would love to discuss my ideas and shortcomings with instructors and progress faster with my learning. 
                    
                    <br>
I love helping people and I would love to give back to the TKH community by volunteering and helping co-worker/colleagues,students, friends with whatever I can.</p>
