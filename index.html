                <p class="lead">My name is Naeem Shafi. I have completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Pakistan. I am a professional IT engineer. I have IT Support experience from Pakistan and UAE. My hobbies include reading books, learning new skills and helping people. 
My future goal is to become a Web Developer. I was introduced to this field in one of my previous jobs and there I realized how interesting and amazing this field is, everything you write comes to life and you can actually see the results of your development in a live environment. I want to use my passion for development to improve my community and people. 
<br> I have so many ideas that I wish to implement but I am lacking the technical skills. I have been been trying to gain the technical skills by learning through freecodecamp, udemy and youtube. I have been trying to find the a proper bootcamp but was unable to join one due to large amount of expenses and that's when I came across TKH. 
I love helping people and I would to give back to the TKH community by volunteering and helping by co-worker/colleagues,students, friends with whatever I can.</p>
